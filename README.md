<p>I am a dog loving, code writing, game playing, car driving hooligan.</p>

<p>There are plenty of things I don't understand or know about computer science... but zero things I am not willing to try and learn.</p>

<p>I started learning python3 on my own back at a dead end job. I wanted a better future. I decided to apply for college after I discovered my love for code. Here are a few insights about my journey so far.</p>

- I really enjoy backend coding.
- I really enjoy frontend coding.
- I prefer linux over windows.
- I have a 120lb American Akita named Grizzlee. He is my rubber duck, but he does not look like one.
- I have done contract work for Burmis Studios.
- I completed an 8 month Co-op for CGI Group, and then continued full-time after school.
- I have been doing my best to learn about UI/UX design to pair with my react skillset.
